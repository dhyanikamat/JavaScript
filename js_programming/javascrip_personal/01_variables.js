/* What are Variables?
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. 
They are an essential part of any programming language, 
as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate 
data in your programs.

There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript,
 each with itsown syntax and rules. In this blog post, we'll take a 
 look at the different types of variables available in JavaScript and 
how to use them.

/*Declaring Variables
To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the "var" keyword followed by 
the name of the variable. For example:

// exercise 1
var x = 10
console.log(x);  // 10
let y = 20
console.log(y);  // 20
const studentid = 16270
console.log(studentid);  //16270
console.table([x,y,studentid]);

// exercise 2
const studentid1 = 162700  // we can not use the studentid because already used in the ex1
let studentname = "Dk"
let studentemail = "dk@gmail.com"
let studentadress = "Ktm,10"
let studentmobile = 9824755793
console.log(studentid1);
console.log(studentname);
console.log(studentemail);
console.log(studentadress);
console.log(studentmobile);
console.table([studentid1,studentname, studentemail, studentadress, studentmobile]);

//exercise 03
const passportid = 135790
let passportname = "DKamat"
let passportissuedate = 2080
let passportexpdate = 2090
console.log(passportid)
console.log(passportname)     // in js no need ;
console.log(passportissuedate)
console.log(passportexpdate)
console.table([passportid, passportname, passportissuedate, passportexpdate])
